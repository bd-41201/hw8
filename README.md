# Homework 8

Build and interpret both a single tree and a random forest. Compare the result to other techniques weâ€™ve learned.

CART: fit, prune, + plot. Concentrate on interpretation.

RF: plot variable importance and predictive performance.

[+] Use Random Forests in treatment effects estimation.

Look back to Lecture 4. Replace lasso estimation for ^d(x) with a random forest. Compare to the original two-lassos algorithm.
